## Overview

-   This quarto doc serves to process & resample all rasters downloaded from Pacific Veg Map to the same resolution and position

-   At the end of the processing, there will be a single raster file for the following forest structure & topographic rasters that covers the entire extent of the Santa Cruz Mountains:

  -   Canopy height
  -   Canopy cover
  -   Digital Elevation Model (DEM)
  -   Aspect
  -   Slope

-   All files from Pacific Veg Map, and all rasters for this analysis, will eventually have a resolution of 5 meters
